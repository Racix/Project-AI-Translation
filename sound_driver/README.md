## Live-recording

### How to run

To run the live recording script, update the `config.yaml` to the correct ip address and/or if you want to record your speakers as well as your mic and then run `sound_driver.exe` to start the script.

### Pre-built script

To use the pre-built script, download the `sound_driver.zip` [here](https://github.com/Racix/Project-AI-Translation/releases), extract the content inside and run the `sound_driver.exe`.

### Build the script yourself

To build the script locally you need to install the `pyinstaller` python module. Then while having a console open, while standing in the sound_driver folder path, run `deploy.bat` which will build the code for you.

### Run the code locally

Install the required python modules stated in the `requirements.txt` file and run `python sound_driver.py` while standing in the sound_driver folder.
